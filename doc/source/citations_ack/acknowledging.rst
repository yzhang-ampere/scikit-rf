Acknowledging or Citing scikit-rf
==================================

In Publications
---------------

If you use `scikit-rf <http://scikit-rf.org>`_ for work/research presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you acknowledge it. Perhaps with something like:

``This research made use of scikit-rf, an open-source Python package for RF and Microwave applications.``

You can also include a link to `<www.scikit-rf.org>`_ (if the journal allows this) in addition to the above text.

For academic citations, please cite the `IEEE Microwave Magazine article <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9632487>`_ that some of the community members wrote.
The IEEE-style citation for this paper is
