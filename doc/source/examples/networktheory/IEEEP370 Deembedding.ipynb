    "The [IEEE 370-2020 standard](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/370/6165/) (_Standard for Electrical Characterization of Printed Circuit Board and Related Interconnects at Frequencies up to 50 GHz_) provides good practices for ensuring the quality of measured data for high-frequency electrical interconnects at frequencies up to 50 GHz. It recommends methods and processes for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of measured data for signals with frequency content up to 50 GHz, in particular for removing test fixture and instrumentation effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, and following the standard proposal on labeling, a 2-port DUT has one fixture attached to each of its ports. The fixture attached to the single-ended DUT port 1 is labeled as FIX-1. The fixture attached to the single-ended DUT port 2 is labeled as FIX-2. The cascade of the DUT and fixtures on both ends is named the composite structure or the FIX-DUT-FIX structure.\n",
